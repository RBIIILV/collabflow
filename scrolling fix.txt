Creating a smooth and user - friendly scrolling experience for a calendar component with an event list in a Next.js React application can be a bit tricky, especially when syncing the calendar with the event list.The jumpy behavior you're describing likely stems from the synchronization logic between the calendar and the event list, particularly when there are large gaps between dates or events. Let’s break this down and address your goals step-by-step:
1. Understanding the Issue
The jumpiness occurs because the scroll position of the event list is likely tied directly to the calendar's date selection or rendering logic. When the event list updates to reflect a new date (e.g., skipping large gaps), the DOM might re-render or adjust its height, causing the scroll to "jump" to accommodate the new content. Additionally, if the calendar and event list are in a single scrollable container, their synchronization might cause unintended shifts.
2. Suggested Approach
To achieve a smooth experience where the top event's date is highlighted on the calendar, and scrolling feels natural, consider the following:
a.Separate Scroll Containers
Use two independent scrollable containers: one for the calendar and one for the event list.This prevents the calendar from affecting the event list's scroll behavior and vice versa.
For example, style the calendar with overflow - y: auto and the event list with its own overflow - y: auto, each with a fixed or dynamic height as needed.
    b.Virtualized List for Events
Since your event list might have large gaps or varying numbers of events, consider using a virtualization library like react-virtualized or react - window.These libraries only render the visible items in the list, reducing the DOM size and preventing performance issues or jumpiness caused by re - rendering many elements.
Install react - window with npm install react - window and wrap your event list in a FixedSizeList or VariableSizeList component, depending on whether your event heights are uniform.
    c.Syncing Date Highlighting
To highlight the date corresponding to the top event in the event list:
Track the scroll position of the event list using the onScroll event.
    Calculate the date of the topmost event based on the scroll position and the height of each event item.
Update the calendar's highlighted date state accordingly.
Use a useRef to access the scroll container and a useState or useEffect to manage the highlighted date.
    d.Smooth Scrolling
Apply CSS properties like scroll - behavior: smooth to the event list container to ensure transitions between scroll positions are fluid.
Avoid forcing the scroll position abruptly(e.g., using scrollTop = someValue) unless absolutely necessary.Instead, use scrollTo with smooth behavior where supported.
3. Example Implementation
Here’s a simplified example to get you started:
jsx
import { useRef, useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { FixedSizeList } from 'react-window';
import './Calendar.css';

const events = [
    { date: new Date('2025-03-15'), title: 'Industry conference', time: '9:00 AM' },
    { date: new Date('2025-03-28'), title: 'Final project submission', time: '5:00 PM' },
    { date: new Date('2025-03-05'), title: 'Annual vacation', time: '12:00 AM' },
];

const Calendar = () => {
    const eventListRef = useRef(null);
    const [highlightedDate, setHighlightedDate] = useState(new Date('2025-03-15'));

    const handleScroll = () => {
        if (eventListRef.current) {
            const scrollTop = eventListRef.current.scrollTop;
            // Calculate the index of the top event based on scroll position and item height
            const itemHeight = 60; // Adjust based on your design
            const index = Math.floor(scrollTop / itemHeight);
            if (events[index]) {
                setHighlightedDate(events[index].date);
            }
        }
    };

    const Row = ({ index, style }) => (
        <div style={style} className="event-item">
            <strong>{events[index].title}</strong> - {events[index].time} ({events[index].date.toDateString()})
        </div>
    );

    return (
        <div className="calendar-container">
            <div className="calendar">
                {/* Simplified calendar rendering */}
                <h3>Calendar for March 2025</h3>
                <div className="days">
                    {Array.from({ length: 31 }, (_, i) => {
                        const date = new Date(2025, 2, i + 1);
                        return (
                            <div
                                key={i}
                                className={`day ${date.toDateString() === highlightedDate.toDateString() ? 'highlighted' : ''}`}
                            >
                                {i + 1}
                            </div>
                        );
                    })}
                </div>
            </div>
            <div
                className="event-list"
                ref={eventListRef}
                onScroll={handleScroll}
                style={{ overflowY: 'auto', height: '300px', scrollBehavior: 'smooth' }}
            >
                <FixedSizeList
                    height={300}
                    width="100%"
                    itemCount={events.length}
                    itemSize={60}
                    overscanCount={5}
                >
                    {Row}
                </FixedSizeList>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
};

export default Calendar;
css
    .calendar - container {
    display: flex;
    flex - direction: column;
    gap: 20px;
}

.calendar {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    padding: 10px;
}

.days {
    display: grid;
    grid - template - columns: repeat(7, 1fr);
    gap: 5px;
}

.day {
    padding: 10px;
    text - align: center;
    border: 1px solid #eee;
}

.day.highlighted {
    background - color: #007bff;
    color: white;
}

.event - list {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
}

.event - item {
    padding: 10px;
    border - bottom: 1px solid #eee;
}
4. Additional Tips
Debounce Scroll Handler: To prevent performance issues from frequent onScroll calls, debounce the handleScroll function using a library like lodash.debounce.
Dynamic Heights: If event items have variable heights, use VariableSizeList from react - window and provide a getItemSize function.
Testing: Test with a large dataset to ensure virtualization handles gaps effectively.Adjust overscanCount to balance performance and smoothness.
