# CollabFlow Product Context

*Last Updated: March 17, 2025*

## Product Vision

CollabFlow aims to be a unified workspace that seamlessly integrates calendar management, task tracking, document management, and AI assistance. The product addresses the fragmentation of productivity tools by providing a centralized platform where users can manage all aspects of their work.

## Problem Statement

Knowledge workers today face several challenges:

1. **Tool Fragmentation**: Using separate tools for calendar, tasks, documents, and communication leads to context switching and reduced productivity.
2. **Information Silos**: Data stored across different platforms makes it difficult to maintain a holistic view of projects.
3. **Manual Synchronization**: Users must manually keep information consistent across different tools.
4. **Limited Context Awareness**: Most tools lack awareness of the broader context of a user's work.

## User Experience Goals

### Unified Interface

CollabFlow provides a cohesive interface where users can:
- View and manage their calendar events
- Track tasks with priorities and deadlines
- Access and organize documents
- Receive AI-powered assistance based on their context

### Project-Centric Organization

- All content (tasks, events, documents) can be associated with specific projects
- Project-specific views filter content to show only relevant information
- Project dashboard provides an overview of all project-related activities

### Seamless Synchronization

- Bidirectional synchronization between calendar and events list
- Document synchronization with Dropbox
- Email integration with major providers (planned)

### Context-Aware AI Assistance

- AI Quick Search for information retrieval
- AI Project Assistant for context-aware recommendations
- Specialized AI assistants for research, legal, and finance (planned)

## User Workflows

### Calendar Management

1. User views their calendar in the right sidebar
2. User creates, edits, or deletes events
3. User can drag and drop events to reschedule them
4. Events can be associated with specific projects

### Task Management

1. User creates tasks with title, description, due date, and priority
2. Tasks are organized by timeframe (Today, Tomorrow, etc.)
3. User can filter tasks by status, priority, or project
4. User can drag and drop tasks to reorder or change status

### Document Management

1. User connects their Dropbox account
2. User browses, uploads, and downloads documents
3. Documents can be associated with specific projects
4. Document versions are tracked and can be viewed

### Project Management

1. User creates projects with name, description, and color
2. User associates tasks, events, and documents with projects
3. User views project-specific dashboards
4. User filters content by project

## Integration Philosophy

CollabFlow is designed to integrate with existing tools rather than replace them:

- **Dropbox Integration**: Leverages Dropbox for document storage and synchronization
- **Email Integration**: Will connect with major email providers (Outlook, Gmail, Apple Mail)
- **Calendar Integration**: Will support synchronization with third-party calendars (planned)

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Intuitive interface that reduces cognitive load
2. **Consistency**: Uniform design language across all components
3. **Responsiveness**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile use
4. **Accessibility**: Follows WCAG guidelines for inclusive design
5. **Performance**: Fast loading times and responsive interactions

## Success Criteria

1. **User Adoption**: Measured by active users and session duration
2. **Feature Engagement**: Tracked usage of calendar, tasks, documents, and AI features
3. **Synchronization Reliability**: Monitored success rate of sync operations
4. **Performance Metrics**: Load times, time to interactive, and other core web vitals
5. **User Satisfaction**: Collected through feedback and surveys
