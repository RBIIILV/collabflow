## Known Issues

### Performance Issues

1. **Project Component LCP**
   - **Issue**: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) is 5776ms, above the recommended threshold
   - **Root Causes**: Large JavaScript bundle size, unoptimized image loading, excessive re-renders
   - **Status**: Being addressed with code splitting and memoization
   - **Priority**: High

2. **Calendar Widget Initial Load**
   - **Issue**: Calendar widget takes ~800ms to fully render on initial load
   - **Root Cause**: Complex date calculations and event positioning
   - **Status**: Investigating optimization opportunities
   - **Priority**: Medium

3. **Task List Rendering**
   - **Issue**: Task list with many items can cause jank when scrolling
   - **Root Cause**: Rendering all tasks at once without virtualization
   - **Status**: Planning to implement virtualization
   - **Priority**: Medium

### UI/UX Issues

1. **Form Input Styling in Dark Mode**
   - **Issue**: Text visibility issues in form inputs when using dark mode
   - **Root Cause**: Hardcoded colors in form components
   - **Status**: Fixed in most components, but need to audit all form inputs
   - **Priority**: Medium

2. **Project Color Picker Accessibility**
   - **Issue**: Color picker doesn't provide enough contrast information
   - **Root Cause**: Missing contrast ratio calculation
   - **Status**: Planning to add contrast ratio indicator
   - **Priority**: Low

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - **Issue**: Some components don't adapt well to very small screens
   - **Root Cause**: Fixed width values instead of responsive units
   - **Status**: Needs comprehensive audit and fixes
   - **Priority**: Medium

### Technical Debt

1. **Inconsistent State Management**
   - **Issue**: Mix of React Query, Context, and local state
   - **Root Cause**: Incremental development without consistent patterns
   - **Status**: Planning to standardize approach
   - **Priority**: Medium

2. **Duplicate API Calls**
   - **Issue**: Some components make redundant API calls
   - **Root Cause**: Missing query key normalization in React Query
   - **Status**: Planning to implement query key factory
   - **Priority**: Medium

3. **Missing Error Boundaries**
   - **Issue**: Errors in one component can crash the entire application
   - **Root Cause**: Lack of error boundary implementation
   - **Status**: Planning to add error boundaries to key components
   - **Priority**: High

### Integration Issues (RESOLVED)

1. **Dropbox Token Refresh**
   - **Issue**: âœ… Occasional failures in Dropbox token refresh
   - **Root Cause**: âœ… Race condition in token refresh logic and deprecated auth-helpers
   - **Status**: âœ… Fixed by migrating to @supabase/ssr and updating cookie handling
   - **Priority**: ~~High~~ âœ… Resolved

2. **Project Tag Synchronization**
   - **Issue**: Project tags sometimes don't update immediately across components
   - **Root Cause**: Missing invalidation in React Query cache
   - **Status**: Planning to implement proper cache invalidation
   - **Priority**: Medium
