# Next.js 15.2 Upgrade Guide

This document outlines the steps taken to upgrade this application to Next.js 15.2 and provides guidance on verifying the upgrade.

## Changes Made

   ```
   next: 15.1.3 → 15.2.0
   react: ^19.0.0 (unchanged)
   react-dom: ^19.0.0 (unchanged)
   eslint-config-next: updated to match
   @next/third-parties: 15.1.5 → 15.2.0
   ```

2. **Configuration Updates**
   - Updated Next.js configuration to leverage stable features in 15.2
   - Used default middleware configuration without experimental features

## New Features Available

1. **Redesigned Error UI and Improved Stack Traces**
   - Better debugging experience with more focused error messages
   - Improved stack trace visualization
   - Error rating system for feedback

2. **Streaming Metadata**
   - Async metadata no longer blocks page rendering or client-side transitions
   - Better SEO support with bot detection

3. **Turbopack Performance Improvements**
   - Up to 57.6% faster compile times
   - 30% reduced memory usage

4. **Node.js Middleware Support (Experimental)**
   - Better compatibility with Node.js libraries
   - Improved performance for database and authentication operations

## Testing and Verification

When testing the upgrade, verify the following:

1. **Core Functionality**
   - User authentication still works correctly through Supabase
   - Navigation between routes works as expected
   - Data fetching and mutation operate correctly

2. **Performance Improvements**
   - Development server should start and compile changes faster
   - Client-side transitions should be smoother

3. **Middleware Functionality**
   - Authentication checks in middleware should work with Node.js runtime
   - Session management should continue to function properly

## Known Issues and Considerations

1. **React Day Picker Compatibility**
   - A warning was displayed about `react-day-picker@8.10.1` expecting React ^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0 
   - This component may need updating if you experience issues

2. **Node.js Middleware (Experimental)**
   - The `nodeMiddleware` feature is only available in canary releases of Next.js 15.2
   - If Node.js runtime capabilities are needed in middleware, you can:
     - Install the canary version: `npm install next@canary`
     - Add the configuration to next.config.ts:
       ```typescript
       experimental: {
         nodeMiddleware: true
       }
       ```
     - Add runtime specification to middleware.ts:
       ```typescript
       export const config = {
         matcher: [...],
         runtime: 'nodejs'
       }
       ```
     - Note: Canary versions are not recommended for production without thorough testing
