## Code Organization

### Project Structure
- Follow Next.js recommended project structure
- Group related components in feature-specific directories
- Keep utility functions in dedicated lib directories
- Store hooks in a centralized hooks directory

### Component Design
- Create small, focused components (max 300 lines)
- Use composition over inheritance
- Follow single responsibility principle
- Document component props and usage

### State Management
- Use React Context for global state
- Prefer local state when possible
- Avoid prop drilling with proper component structure
- Use React Query for server state management

---

## Development Workflow

### Git Practices
- Use feature branches for new development
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Rebase instead of merge when updating branches
- Squash commits before merging to main

### Code Reviews
- Review all pull requests thoroughly
- Provide constructive feedback
- Verify functionality and code quality
- Ensure tests are included for new features

### Environment Management
- Maintain separate environment configurations
- Use .env files for sensitive configuration
- Document environment setup process
- Keep development and production environments in sync

---

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Create integration tests for key workflows
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical paths
- Maintain test coverage above 80%

### Code Quality
- Use ESLint for static code analysis
- Run Prettier for consistent formatting
- Perform regular code audits
- Refactor code to improve maintainability

### Performance Monitoring
- Profile application performance regularly
- Optimize critical rendering paths
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical components
- Monitor bundle size and optimize dependencies

---

## Collaboration Practices

### Documentation
- Maintain up-to-date project documentation
- Document architectural decisions
- Keep README files current
- Use comments judiciously in code

### Communication
- Use clear, concise language in code reviews
- Document decisions in pull requests
- Maintain a shared knowledge base
- Conduct regular team syncs

### Continuous Improvement
- Conduct retrospectives after major milestones
- Identify areas for process improvement
- Share knowledge through code walkthroughs
- Stay updated with industry best practices
