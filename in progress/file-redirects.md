# File Redirects

This document provides redirects from old files to the new consolidated files.

## Consolidated Files

The project documentation has been streamlined into the following key files:

1. **project-status.md** - Current project status, completed features, and next steps
2. **technical-guides.md** - Technical guidelines for styling, component development, and database integration
3. **feature-implementations.md** - Detailed implementation of key features
4. **architecture-diagrams.md** - Architectural diagrams for the project
5. **development-guidelines.md** - Development guidelines based on .clinerules
6. **mcp-integration.md** - Guide for using MCP servers in the project

## How to Use This Document

When looking for information that was previously in one of the deprecated files, refer to the corresponding consolidated file. The consolidated files have been organized to make information easier to find and maintain.

## Benefits of Consolidation

1. **Reduced Token Usage**: Fewer files with more focused content reduces token usage when accessing project documentation.
2. **Improved Organization**: Related information is grouped together for easier reference.
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Fewer files to update when project details change.
4. **Clearer Structure**: Consistent formatting and organization across all documentation.
5. **Better Navigation**: Clear table of contents in each file makes it easy to find specific information.

## Memory Graph Integration

The memory graph has also been updated to reflect this consolidated structure. When using MCP tools to access project information, the memory graph will provide the most current and accurate information based on these consolidated files.
