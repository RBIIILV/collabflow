# Supabase Integration Summary

## Development Mode Improvements

We've implemented several improvements to make the calendar events feature work seamlessly in development mode without requiring authentication:

### 1. Mock Data in Development Mode

- Added test events with unique IDs (dev-1, dev-2, etc.) in `useCalendarEvents.ts`
- Created a development mode detection using `window.location.hostname === 'localhost'`
- Automatically uses test events in development mode without requiring authentication

```typescript
// Check if we're in development mode
const isDevelopment = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.hostname === 'localhost';

async function fetchEventsForMonth(date: Date): Promise<CalendarEvent[]> {
    // In development mode, return test events
    if (isDevelopment) {
        console.log("Development mode: Using test events")
        return testEvents
    }
    
    // Otherwise, fetch from Supabase
    // ...
}
```

### 2. Mock Event Operations

- Implemented mock versions of `createEvent`, `updateEvent`, and `deleteEvent` functions
- These functions manipulate the local test events array in development mode
- Provides a seamless development experience without requiring a Supabase connection

```typescript
async function createEvent(event: Omit<CalendarEvent, 'id' | 'created_at'>): Promise<CalendarEvent> {
    // In development mode, create a mock event
    if (isDevelopment) {
        console.log("Development mode: Creating mock event", event)
        const mockEvent: CalendarEvent = {
            id: Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 15),
            created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
            ...event
        }
        
        // Add to test events for display
        testEvents.push(mockEvent)
        
        return mockEvent
    }
    
    // Otherwise, create in Supabase
    // ...
}
```

### 3. Authentication Bypass

- The EventForm component uses a test user ID in development mode
- Fixed duplicate key issues by ensuring all test user IDs are unique
- Cookie parsing errors are non-critical and don't affect functionality

```typescript
// In EventForm.tsx
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    console.log("Development mode: Using mock users list")
    setUsers([
        {
            id: userId,
            email: user?.email || 'Current User'
        },
        {
            id: "test-user-id-123456789", // Changed from b9b36d04-59e0-49d7-83ff-46c5186a8cf4
            email: "test@example.com"
        }
    ])
}
```

### 4. Fallback Mechanism

- If API calls fail in development mode, the system automatically falls back to test events
- Error messages are displayed but don't block functionality

```typescript
try {
    // API call logic
} catch (err) {
    console.error('Error in fetchEventsForMonth:', err)

    // Fallback to test events in development mode if there's an error
    if (isDevelopment) {
        console.warn("Falling back to test events after error")
        return testEvents
    }
    
    throw err
}
```

## Remaining Issues

- There's still a non-critical cookie parsing warning in the console: `Failed to parse cookie string: SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'b', "base64-eyJ"... is not valid JSON`
- This warning occurs because the Supabase client is trying to parse an authentication cookie that's not in the expected format
- Since we're in development mode and using mock data, this warning doesn't affect the functionality of the application

## Next Steps

1. **Commit the changes**: The development mode improvements have been committed to the repository
2. **Testing in production**: Test the calendar events feature in a production environment with proper authentication
3. **Implement additional features**: Continue with the planned features like drag-and-drop event rescheduling, calendar view options, etc.
