# Supabase Integration Summary

This document provides a summary of the Supabase integration plan and the steps that have been completed and those that still need to be done.

## Completed Steps

1. **Analysis of Current State**
   - Identified existing tables and their structures
   - Analyzed current RLS policies
   - Reviewed Next.js integration with Supabase

2. **Created Migration for User Roles and RLS**
   - Created a new migration file: `supabase/migrations/20250226000000_user_roles_and_rls.sql`
   - Defined admin and user roles
   - Created consistent RLS policies across all tables
   - Added RPC function to get user role

3. **Updated Database Types**
   - Updated `nextjs/src/lib/database.types.ts` to include all tables and their types
   - Added the `auth_role` enum type
   - Added the `get_auth_user_role` function type

4. **Updated Auth Handling**
   - Updated `nextjs/src/lib/auth.ts` to include role-based access control
   - Added `isAdmin` flag to the `useAuth` hook
   - Added `isCurrentUserAdmin` function
   - Updated auth functions to use the RPC function

5. **Updated UI Components**
   - Updated `nextjs/src/components/sidebar-left.tsx` to show admin-only links
   - Updated `nextjs/src/components/events-list.tsx` to show events from other users for admins
   - Updated `nextjs/src/components/EventForm.tsx` to allow admins to create events for other users
   - Added visual indicators for events owned by other users

6. **Created Documentation**
   - Created a detailed plan in `in progress/supabase-integration-plan.txt`
   - Created a guide for applying the migration in `in progress/apply-migration-guide.md`
   - Created a guide for updating Next.js components in `in progress/update-nextjs-components-guide.md`

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Migration to Hosted Supabase**
   - Follow the instructions in `in progress/apply-migration-guide.md`
   - Verify that the migration was applied successfully

2. **Testing**
   - Test that users can only access their own data
   - Test that admins can access all data
   - Test that admin-only features are hidden from regular users
   - Test that admin users can access all features
   - Test that admin users can create events for other users

## Implementation Roadmap

Here's a suggested order for implementing the remaining steps:

1. **Apply the Migration**
   - Log in to the Supabase dashboard
   - Run the migration SQL script
   - Verify that the migration was applied successfully

2. **Final Testing**
   - Test all features as both a regular user and an admin user
   - Verify that RLS policies are working as expected
   - Test the admin-only features:
     - Viewing all events in the calendar
     - Creating events for other users
     - Accessing admin-only links in the sidebar

## Conclusion

By following this plan, you will create a secure and well-structured database with proper access controls for different user roles. The role-based access control system will allow you to create a more user-friendly application with different features for different user roles.

If you have any questions or encounter any issues during the implementation, please refer to the detailed documentation or ask for assistance.
