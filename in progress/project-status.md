## Implementation Approach

To ensure successful implementation, we follow these principles:

### Iterative Development
- Break features into smaller tasks
- Implement one feature at a time
- Get feedback early and often

### Code Quality
- Follow clean coding principles from `.clinerules`
- Keep components under 300 lines
- Write comprehensive tests
- Document all new components

### Collaboration
- Use Git-based workflow with clear commit messages
- Create feature branches for each major feature
- Conduct code reviews before merging

### MCP Server Integration
- Leverage existing MCP servers for relevant functionality
- Extend perplexity-mcp for specialized AI assistants
- Use sequentialthinking for complex problem-solving
